This enables many features within slurm, including job resource tracking and providing a necessary building block to slurm federation.\nStep 1 - Setup External Accounting Database The first requirement is to setup an external database that Slurm can use to store the accounting data.\nUse the following CloudFormation Quick-Create link to create the database in your AWS account. Note that if you would like to create the database in a different region, change the value of the region parameter in the URL to the region of your choice and reload the page.\nDeploy Accounting Database When you\u0026rsquo;re creating the stack, be sure to specify the VPC ID and Subnets parameters to correspond to the VPC where you are creating the stack. All other values should be suitable as defaults, however feel free to change the database instance type depending on your workload needs.\nChange the region in the URL to create the stack in a region separate from us-east-1.\nStep 2- Retrieve the outputs from the CloudFormation stack Once the stack has reached a Completed state. You will need to go to the Outputs tab of the stack and make note of the properties as they will be used in the creation of your cluster.\nStep 3 - Add permissions to your lambda In order to allow our cluster access to secrets we need to add an additional IAM policy.\nGo to the Lambda Console (deeplink) and search for ParallelClusterFunction Select the function then Configuration \u0026gt; Permissions \u0026gt; Click on the role under Role name. Select the AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess policy and remove it Select Add permissions \u0026gt; Attach policies Search for AdministratorAccess \u0026gt; click Attach policies Step 4 - Create Your Cluster Next, go to Pcluster Manager and choose the option to create a new cluster.\nSelect Wizard option and click next Cluster Properties Choose a suitable name for your cluster, and then in the Cluster Properties window, be sure to choose the VPC that you used when creating the slurm-accounting CloudFormation stack.\nHeadNode Properties You will need to enable the Virtual Console option as that allows Pcluster Manager to interact with the cluster directly:\nBe sure to also enable the Security Group referenced in the CloudFormation outputs so that the HeadNode can access the database.\nNext we\u0026rsquo;ll enable a known script that will install slurm accounting on the HeadNode.\nChoose the advanced options Under the On Configured option, Choose the Multi-Script Runner which has some pre-programmed scripts in it In the search box choose Slurm Accounting Fill in the values for the Secret ARN and RDS Endpoint from the CloudFormation output Under IAM Policies add arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecretsManagerReadWrite so that the HeadNode can access the password to the database.
