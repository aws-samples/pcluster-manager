In this tutorial we will work through setting up Slurm Accounting. This enables many features within slurm, including job resource tracking and providing a necessary building block to slurm federation.

## Step 1 - Setup External Accounting Database

The first requirement is to setup an external database that Slurm can use to store the accounting data.

Use the following CloudFormation Quick-Create link to create the database in
your AWS account. Note that if you would like to create the databas in a
different region, change the value of the `region` parameter in the URL to the
region of your choice and reload the page.

[![Launch](https://samdengler.github.io/cloudformation-launch-stack-button-svg/images/launch-stack.svg)](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?stackName=slurm-accounting&templateURL=https://pcluster-manager-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/slurm-accounting/accounting-cluster-template.yaml)

When you're creating the stack, be sure to specify the `VPC ID` and `Subnets`
parameters to correspond to the VPC where you are creating the stack. All other
values should be suitable as defaults, however feel free to change the database
instance type depending on your workload needs.

{{% notice info %}}
Change the region in the URL to create the stack in a region separate from `us-east-1`.

## Step 2- Retrieve the outputs from the CloudFormation stack

Once the stack has reached a Completed state. You will need to go to the `Outputs` tab of the stack and make note of the properties as they will be used in the creation of your cluster.

## Step 3 - Add permissions to your lambda

In order to allow our cluster access to secrets we need to add an additional IAM policy.

1. Go to the [Lambda Console (deeplink)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?#/functions?f0=true&n0=false&op=and&v0=ParallelClusterFunction) and search for `ParallelClusterFunction`
2. Select the function then `Configuration` > `Permissions` > Click on the role under `Role name`.
3. Select the `AWSXRayDaemonWriteAcess` policy then click `Remove`

![Attach Policies](accounting/remove-policy.png)


4. Select `Add permissions` > `Attach policies` > search for `SecretsManagerReadWrite`
5. Click `Attach policies`

![Attach Policies](accounting/attach-policy.png)


## Step 4 - Create Your Cluster

Next, go to Pcluster Manager and choose the ![Create](create.png) option to create a new cluster.

1. Select **Wizard** option and click next

### Cluster Properties

Choose a suitable name for your cluster, and then in the Cluster Properties window, be sure to choose the VPC that you used when creating the slurm-accounting CloudFormation stack.

![Cluster Properties](accounting/cluster-properties.png)

### HeadNode Properties

You will need to enable the `Virtual Console` option as that allows Pcluster Manager to interact with the cluster directly:

![Cluster Properties](accounting/headnode-virtual-console.png)

Be sure to also enable the Security Group referenced in the CloudFormation outputs so that the HeadNode can access the database.

Next we'll enable a known script that will install slurm accounting on the HeadNode.
- Choose the advanced options
- Under the `On Configured` option, Choose the `Multi-Script Runner` which has some pre-programmed scripts in it
- In the search box choose `Slurm Accounting`
- Fill in the values for the `Secret ARN` and `RDS Endpoint` from the CloudFormation output
- Under `IAM Policies` add `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecretsManagerReadWrite` so that the HeadNode can access the password to the database. Be sure to actually click `Add` so that it is added to the list.

## Review Config

After you've configured the HeadNode, Filesystem and Queues, you'll be asked to review the config. The following parameters **must** be set:

| Parameter                      | Description                                        |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| [AdditionalSecurityGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/HeadNode-v3.html#yaml-HeadNode-Networking-AdditionalSecurityGroups)       | `SlurmDbSecurityGroupId` (CloudFormation)            |
| [AdditionalIamPolicies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/HeadNode-v3.html#yaml-HeadNode-Iam-AdditionalIamPolicies)          | `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`, `SecretsManagerReadWrite` (CloudFormation) |
| [CustomActions/OnNodeConfigured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/HeadNode-v3.html#yaml-HeadNode-CustomActions-OnNodeConfigured) | [multi-runner.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/pcluster-manager/main/resources/scripts/multi-runner.py)                                                   |
| **Arg 0:** Accounting Script                         | [slurm-accounting.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/pcluster-manager/main/resources/scripts/slurm-accounting.sh)                         |
| **Arg 1:** SECRET_ARN              | `SlurmDbPasswordSecretArn` (CloudFormation)          |
| **Arg 2:** RDS Endpoint            | `SlurmDbEndpoint` (CloudFormation)                   |
| **Arg 3:** Port                    | Default is `3306`                                    |

Here's an example config file to reference, take a look a the comments to see what's required:

```yaml
HeadNode:
  InstanceType: t2.micro
  Networking:
    SubnetId: subnet-12345678910
    AdditionalSecurityGroups:
      - sg-12345678910  # Security Group `SlurmDbSecurityGroup`
  Iam:
    AdditionalIamPolicies:
      - Policy: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore
      - Policy: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecretsManagerReadWrite # Policy `SecretsManagerReadWrite`
  CustomActions:
    OnNodeConfigured:
      Script: >-
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/pcluster-manager/main/resources/scripts/multi-runner.py
      Args:
        - >-

        - '-arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:DbPasswdSecret' # `SlurmDbPasswordSecretArn`
        - '-slurmdb-rds-instance.c123456.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com' # RDS Endpoint `SlurmDbEndpoint`
        - '-3306' # Default Port 3306

  SlurmQueues:
    - Name: queue0
      ComputeResources:
        - Name: queue0-t2-micro
          MinCount: 0
          MaxCount: 4
          InstanceType: t2.micro

        SubnetIds:
          - subnet-12345678910

```

## Step 5 - Submit a job

Once the cluster has been successfully created, go to the `Scheduling` tab and select `Submit Job`

![Cluster Properties](accounting/submit-job.png)

Choose a name for your job, a number of nodes to run under, choose to `Run a command` and provide a simple `sleep 30` command.

![Cluster Properties](accounting/submit-job-dialog.png)

## Step 5 - View the Accounting Tab

Once you've submitted a job, you can see the job information under the `Accounting tab`

You can use any of the filters at the top to narrow down the number of jobs in the view to select specific jobs. 

![Cluster Properties](accounting/job-list.png)

If you choose the Job ID in the left column you can see further detials about the job.
