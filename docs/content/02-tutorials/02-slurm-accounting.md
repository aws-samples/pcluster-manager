![Accounting Architecture](02-slurm-accounting/architecture.png)

In this tutorial we will work through setting up [Slurm Accounting](https://slurm.schedmd.com/accounting.html). This is a pre-requisite for many features within Slurm, including job resource tracking and [Slurm Federation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/federation.html). Starting in **3.3.0** Slurm accounting is setup directly in the ParallelCluster Manager interface. This tutorial assumes you're creating a cluster **>= 3.3.0**.

### Step 1 - Setup External Accounting Database

The first requirement is to setup an external database that Slurm can use to store the accounting data. Use the following CloudFormation Quick-Create link to create the database in your AWS account:
  
{{% button href="https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#/stacks/create/review?stackName=pcluster-slurm-db&templateURL=https://us-east-1-aws-parallelcluster.s3.amazonaws.com/templates/1-click/serverless-database.yaml" icon="fas fa-rocket" %}}Deploy Accounting Database{{% /button %}}

{{% notice info %}}
Change the region in the upper right to create the database in a region separate from `us-east-2`.
{{% /notice %}}

Change the following stack parameters:

* **Password** create a password for your database
* **VPC** use the same VPC as you plan on creating the cluster in
* **Subnet1** use the same subnet as you plan on creating the cluster in
* **Subnet2** use another subnet from the same VPC. This is for High-Availability (HA) purposes.

The rest you can leave as default. Click create and wait **~30 minutes** for the stack to create.

### Step 2 - Retrieve the outputs from the CloudFormation stack

Once the stack creation has completed, go to the **Outputs** tab of the stack and make note of the properties as they will be used in the creation of your cluster:

### Step 3 - Create Your Cluster

Next, go to ParallelCluster Manager and choose the **Create** option to create a new cluster.

#### Slurm Settings

Under the HeadNode section, you'll find a section called **Slurm Properties**. Enter in information from the cloudformation stack outputs for Database, Username, and Password, you can use the following mapping to go from CloudFormation to ParallelCluster Manager:

| Parameter                      | CloudFormation Stack Output                        |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Database**                   | `DatabaseHost:DatabasePort`                        |
| **Username**                   | `DatabaseAdminUser`                                |
| **Password**                   | `DatabaseSecretArn`                                |
| **Additional Security Groups** | `DatabaseClientSecurityGroup`                      |

![Slurm Settings](02-slurm-accounting/cluster-properties.png)

Also on the HeadNode tab, under **AdditionalSecurityGroups** select the `DatabaseClientSecurityGroup` security group output from CloudFormation:

## Review Config

After you've configured the HeadNode, Filesystem and Queues, you'll be asked to review the config. Here's an example of what the SlurmSettings section should look like:

```yaml
SlurmSettings:
    Database:
      Uri: slurm-accounting-cluster.cluster-hash.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com:3306
      UserName: clusteradmin
      PasswordSecretArn: arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:123456789:secret:AccountingClusterAdminSecre-hash2
```

{{% notice info %}}
You'll see a warning like: `Cannot validate secret arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:AccountingClusterAdminSecret due to lack of permissions. Please refer to ParallelCluster official documentation for more information.` which can be safely ignored.

## Step 5 - Submit a job

Once the cluster has been successfully created, we can submit a job to see that accounting is working properly.

1. SSH into the Cluster, if you've enabled "Virtual Console" you can click on the "Shell" button.
2. Submit a job with the following command:

```bash
sbatch --wrap 'sleep 30'
```

## Step 6 - View the Accounting Tab

Once you've submitted a job, you can see the job information under the `Accounting tab`

You can use any of the filters at the top to narrow down the number of jobs in the view to select specific jobs.

If you choose the Job ID in the left column you can see further detials about the job.
