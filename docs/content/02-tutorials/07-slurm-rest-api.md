Enable the Slurm REST API. Requires Slurm Accounting.

## Step 1 - Setup Slurm Accounting

Slurm Accounting is required to enable the Slurm REST API. Follow the [instructions](https://pcluster.cloud/02-tutorials/02-slurm-accounting.html) to enable Slurm Accounting but **do not begin cluster creation** after completing Step 4.

## Step 2 - Create a Security Group to allow inbound HTTPS traffic

By default, your cluster will not be able to accept incoming HTTPS requests to the REST API. You will need to [create a security group](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#CreateSecurityGroup:) to change this.

1. Under `Security group name`, enter "Slurm REST API" (or another name of your choosing)
2. Ensure `VPC` matches the cluster's VPC
3. Delete any outbound rules that may have been automatically generated
4. Add an inbound rule and select `HTTPS` under `Type` and `My IP` under `Destination`
5. Click `Create security group`

## Step 3 - Configure your cluster

In your cluster configuration, return to the Head Node section and add your security group.

Under `Advanced options`, you should have already added a script for Slurm Accounting. 
In the same multi-runner, click `Add Script` and select `Slurm REST API`.

Create your cluster. Make sure you followed the Slurm Accounting tutorial for the rest of the configuration.

## Step 4 - Submit a job

Once the cluster has been successfully created, go to the `Job Scheduling` tab and select `Submit Job`

Choose a name for your job, a number of nodes to run under, and select `Run a script (manual entry)` and enter `srun sleep 30` on line 2 under `#!/bin/bash`.

Click `submit`. If the job was successful, it should be listed as `COMPLETED` in about 30 seconds.

### Troubleshooting

If jobs aren't submitting, it's likely because of security groups. Try manually adding your IP to the new security group you created.  
If you're still running issues, you can select `Any IPv4` as the destination (**WARNING:** this may have potential security risks).
