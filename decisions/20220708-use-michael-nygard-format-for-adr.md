## Context
Adopting a format for ADR which is too verbose might prevent people from writing them, as they might consider the activity too time consuming.

## Decision
We decided to adopt the format proposed by Michael Nygard, as it is brief enough to be written rapidly and conveys enough information for making the adoption of ADR valuable.

## Consequences
- People might be more keen to write ADRs as the format is simpler
- We might risk to loose the driver for some decisions and the options evaluated
