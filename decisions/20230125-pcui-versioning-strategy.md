# PCUI Versioning strategy

- Status: accepted
- Deciders: Nuraghe Team
- Tags: versioning, pcui

## Context
We want to avoid confusing for customers using PC UI and Parallel Cluster.

## Decision
Using the format YYYY.MM[.REVISION] for PC UI versions, where 

- YYYY is the full year in which PC UI gets released
- MM is the two digit number for the month in which PC UI gets released
- REVISION is an optional value to allow separation of patches between the same major version
