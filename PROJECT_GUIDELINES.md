# Project Guidelines

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

- You have added tests, even if just the happy path, when adding or refactoring code
- You used types in your TypeScript code so that we can leverage static analysis to maintain quality
- You have interationalized any user-facing text or copy, by using our `i18n` solution ([as shown here](https://github.com/aws-samples/pcluster-manager/pull/175/commits/fdc6b77987c87a26f51dbc8da5d371d95ef80601)) so that we can translate to other languages in the future
- You have followed the PR Quality Checklist available in our [Pull Request Template](.github/pull_request_template.md)
