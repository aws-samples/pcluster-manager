To sign in, enter your AWS Account ID or alias, IAM user name, and password that was provided to you for this lab.
After you sign in, take a few minutes to explore the navigation components of the AWS Management Console.
A search bar allows you to quickly locate services based on text.</description></item><item><title>b. Deploy Pcluster Manager</title><link>https://pcluster.cloud/01-getting-started/02-pcmanager-install.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pcluster.cloud/01-getting-started/02-pcmanager-install.html</guid><description>The AWS ParallelCluster API has been released with the version 3 of AWS ParallelCluster. It enables you to to manage clusters though an API hosted on AWS and build workflows to manage your cluster lifecycle with Python.
Pcluster Manager is a web UI that built upon the AWS ParallelCluster CLI that you can use to manage your compute clusters. It&amp;rsquo;ll take about 20 minutes to deploy both stacks. You will initiate the deployment now to have it ready by the time you need it.</description></item><item><title>c.

Click on the link to login with the temporary code provided. Enter the credentials using the email you used when deploying the stack and the temporary password from the email above. You will be asked to provide a new password. Enter a new password to complete signup. Congrats! You are ready to create your HPC cluster in AWS.</description></item><item><title>d.

Slurm Accounting 🪄</title><link>https://pcluster.cloud/02-tutorials/02-slurm-accounting.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pcluster.cloud/02-tutorials/02-slurm-accounting.html</guid><description>In this tutorial we will work through setting up Slurm Accounting. This enables many features within slurm, including job resource tracking and providing a necessary building block to slurm federation.
Step 1 - Setup External Accounting Database The first requirement is to setup an external database that Slurm can use to store the accounting data.
Use the following CloudFormation Quick-Create link to create the database in your AWS account. Note that if you would like to create the database in a different region, change the value of the region parameter in the URL to the region of your choice and reload the page.</description></item><item><title>c. Memory Scheduling 💾</title><link>https://pcluster.cloud/02-tutorials/03-memory-scheduling.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pcluster.cloud/02-tutorials/03-memory-scheduling.html</guid><description>Slurm supports memory based scheduling via a --mem or --mem-per-cpu flag provided at job submission time. This allows scheduling of jobs with high memory requirements, allowing users to guarantee a set amount of memory per-job or per-process.
For example users can run:
sbatch --mem-per-cpu=64G -n 8 ... To get 8 vcpus and 64 gigs of memory.
In order to add in memory information, we have a managed post-install script that can be setup with Pcluster Manager.</description></item><item><title>d. Cost Tracking 💰</title><link>https://pcluster.cloud/02-tutorials/04-cost-tracking.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pcluster.cloud/02-tutorials/04-cost-tracking.html</guid><description>Cost Tracking is essential to every single HPC workload, it&amp;rsquo;s important to be able to track costs per-user, per-project, per-slurm-partition and track these costs overtime.
There&amp;rsquo;s two different ways to setup cost tracking, each with their own tradeoffs:
To see historical spend on a per-job basis, setup Slurm Accounting 🪄. This will allow you to query for job runtimes, who submitted what jobs, how many instances and duration of the job.</description></item><item><title>d. Cloud9 ☁️</title><link>https://pcluster.cloud/02-tutorials/05-cloud9.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pcluster.cloud/02-tutorials/05-cloud9.html</guid><description>Cloud9 is a web-based code editor, terminal and file-browser. You can connect to the cluster via Cloud9 and advantage of the following convenient features:
Terminal Drag &amp;amp; Drop file upload Code editor Setup To setup the connection, we need to run a script to install the Cloud9 packages on the HeadNode.
From the Pcluster Manager GUI create a new cluster. Select the Wizard option: On the HeadNode configuration tab Expand Advanced Options &amp;gt; turn on Multi-Script Runner &amp;gt; select Cloud9 On the final screen review and make sure your config looks similar to the following.</description></item><item><title>d.

Setup In order to download a file when you start your cluster,
From the Pcluster Manager GUI create a new cluster. Select the Wizard option: On the HeadNode configuration tab Expand Advanced Options &amp;gt; turn on Multi-Script Runner &amp;gt; select Downloader Note: You can specify either an http://, https:// or s3:// endpoint, however for any s3 location it must reside in the same region as the cluster.</description></item></channel></rss>
